Elgg has its own plug-in architecture, and can use plug-ins to provide a calendar and a wiki. It supports a number of open standards including RSS, LDAP for authentication, FOAF, and XML-RPC for integration with most third-party blogging clients. It can be integrated with MediaWiki, Moodle, Drupal, and WebCT.\nElgg provides each user with a personal weblog, file repository (with podcasting capabilities), an online profile, and an RSS reader. Additionally, all of a user's content can be tagged with keywords\u00e2\u20ac\u201dso they can connect with other users with similar interests and create their own personal learning network. However, where Elgg differs from a regular weblog or a commercial social network (such as MySpace) is the degree of control each user is given over who can access their content. Each profile item, blog post, or uploaded file can be assigned its own access restrictions\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfrom fully public to readable only by a particular group or individual.\nUsing Elgg is the easiest way to create your own fully customized, hosted social network for your business, organization, or group of friends.

{"detailed description": "The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) is software that allows a computer to act as a print server, receiving print jobs from client computers, managing them, and sending them to the appropriate printer. It consists of a print spooler and scheduler, filters to convert print jobs to the format required by each printer, and a backend system to send the data to the chosen printer from client applications. Since every printer manufacturer does things differently, printing can be very complicated, and has always been a hard issue in the UNIX world for this reason. By providing a portable, modular printing layer, CUPS brings printing for UNIX into the modern age. It applies open standards for network printing through the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) and uses platform-independent drivers (Postscript Printer Definition, PPD) to print. Today, CUPS is the default printing system for a large number of Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.) and UNIX-based operating systems.\nThis book assumes that you have no knowledge of CUPS. It starts by telling you the story of how CUPS came to be and why there is such excitement about it. We then move on to installing, compiling, and managing your print network. Haven't you struggled to find the right directives for your printer? Enough of that search, this book will tell you where to find what. Not only that, but widely used directives and their uses are explained here along with directions to use them. There is more: you can learn how to manage the ever increasing print job load, set up your clients, and manage users. All this done, you will learn how to monitor, filter, and secure your CUPS server.", "isbn": "1847192580", "title": "CUPS Administrative Guide", "price_gbp": 30, "audience": "This book is for Linux/Unix System Administrators interested in designing and setting up a CUPS network and provides enough knowledge to understand how the technology works, make decisions about deployment, and then implement a stable work environment.
